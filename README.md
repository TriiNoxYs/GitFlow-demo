# GitFlow-demo
Welcome to my GitFlow exemple repo!  
Here, I will make a kind of GitFlow cheat-sheet, directly as a git repo.  

Version: 2.0.2


# Release notes
In the first release, I created two features: write-readme and add-homepage.
Then, I created a new release: v1.0.0

Now, in this second release, I created two mores features: add-image and add-footer.
Then, I created a new release: v2.0.0

But wait! I mispelled my name in the footer! Hotfixes 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 are here to resolve this.
